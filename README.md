# Cryptobook

UTS iOS Development assignment 3

Cryptocurrency app that fetches top 50 currency prices and their details and allows the user to favorite and make them much more accessible. The app also includes a currency converter. The focus of the app is that it's mainly used to check prices in a quick way and doesn't have an overwhelming amount of information on the screen.


## Framework
We used **Alamofire** to make the API requests to get the information
